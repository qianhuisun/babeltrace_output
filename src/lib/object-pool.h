/*
 * This is a generic object pool to avoid memory allocation/deallocation
 * for objects of which the lifespan is typically short, but which are
 * created a lot.
 *
 * The object pool, thanks to two user functions, knows how to allocate
 * a brand new object in memory when the pool is empty and how to
 * destroy an object when we destroy the pool.
 *
 * The object pool's user is responsible for:
 *
 * * Setting whatever references the object needs to keep and reset some
 *   properties _after_ calling bt_object_pool_create_object(). This is
 *   typically done in the bt_*_create() function which calls
 *   bt_object_pool_create_object() (which could call the user-provided
 *   allocation function if the pool is empty) and then sets the
 *   appropriate properties on the possibly recycled object.
 *
 * * Releasing whatever references the object keeps _before_ calling
 *   bt_object_pool_recycle_object(). This is typically done in a custom
 *   bt_*_recycle() function which does the necessary before calling
 *   bt_object_pool_recycle_object() with an object ready to be reused
 *   at any time.
