A compcls:sink.utils.dummy sink component can be useful to run a trace
processing graph with no sink side effect, for example to perform
benchmarks. Prefer a compcls:sink.utils.dummy component class for such
tasks to, for example, a compcls:sink.text.pretty component and sending
its output to `/dev/null`, as a compcls:sink.text.pretty component still
performs formatting operations.
